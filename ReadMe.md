Introduction:
The interplay between incarceration rates and crime has been a topic of intense debate and empirical scrutiny. This project aims to analyze the impact of repeated incarceration, often termed as 'prison cycling', on crime rates within communities. Utilizing a linear regression framework, we explore the relationship between repeated incarceration and crime rates while considering various socio-economic factors. The study utilizes a rich dataset encompassing crime rates, prison cycling data, and census tract information from 2008 to 2010 to unravel the complexities of crime dynamics in different socio-economic landscapes.

Data & Methods:
The analysis focuses on the Boston region and utilizes a dataset comprising four Stata (.dta) files representing distinct geographic areas. After careful consideration, ten variables were chosen for analysis, including prison cycling data and various socio-economic factors. Exploratory data analysis techniques such as box plots, scatter plots, and correlation matrices were used to understand the data distribution and relationships between variables.

Model Development:
The initial analysis involved fitting a base model with seven independent variables. However, several assumptions of linear regression were violated, including the constant variance of residuals, normality of residuals, and autocorrelation in residuals. To address these issues, influential points and outliers were detected and removed, resulting in improvements in model performance.

Discussion & Conclusion:
The findings from the linear regression model challenge commonly held beliefs regarding the relationship between incarceration rates and crime. Contrary to expectations, prison cycling might have a positive correlation with total crime rates in the long run. Socio-economic factors such as unemployment rate and residential mobility emerged as significant predictors of crime rates, highlighting the importance of economic stability and community cohesion in crime prevention strategies.
